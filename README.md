Prodigy InfoTech Internship Task 3: Keylogger Program

Task Description:
As part of my internship at Prodigy InfoTech, I was tasked with developing a keylogger program. 
A keylogger is a technique used in cybersecurity to monitor and record keystrokes made by a target user. This tool can be used to understand user behavior or for malicious purposes if used unethically.

Program Functionality:
The Python program I developed performs the following functions:

Keylogging:
Upon running the program, it monitors all keystrokes made by the user.
Each keystroke is recorded and stored in a text file for later review.

Security and Ethical Considerations:
While developing and running keylogger programs can be educational and useful for cybersecurity research, it is important to emphasize that using keyloggers without explicit consent from the user is illegal and unethical. 
Keyloggers should only be used in controlled environments where all parties are aware of the monitoring.

This program demonstrates a basic implementation of a keylogger, highlighting both its potential applications in cybersecurity and the importance of ethical considerations when using such tools.
